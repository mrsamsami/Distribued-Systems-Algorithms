# Distributed Systems and Algorithms
This repository provides codes for some distributed algorithms and frameworks. All code is written in Python 3, using multithreading, socket programming, and PySpark.

**Note**: These are implemented algorithms for selected exercises of [distributed systems course](http://sina.sharif.ir/~saleh/DS.pdf) taught by Prof. Saleh in Spring 2020.

## List of Implementations:
- [Network size estimation with flooding algorithm](network%20size%20estimation%20with%20flooding.py)
- [Network size estimation with gossip algorithm](network%20size%20estimation%20with%20gossip.py)
- [PageRank algorithm with Spark](PageRank%20with%20Spark.py)

## Environment Requirement
* Python 3.6.5

    * PySpark 3.0.0
    * NumPy 1.14.3
